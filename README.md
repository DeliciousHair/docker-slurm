# Slurm in Docker

### Docker images with Slurm Workload Manager installed

This repository contains setup files for Ubuntu-based Docker images and containers with the [Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) installed.  These images are primarily designed to serve as an environment to experiment with Slurm or run unit/integration tests of code that will later be run on high-performance computing (HPC) resources.
